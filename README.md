# Surfs_up
## Overview: 
### The purpose of this project was to identify whether a surf and ice cream shop should be open all year or during certain seasons of the year. 
---
# Results 
## Breakdown: Our analysis focused on a years worth of data from August 2016 - August 2017. Below is our findings.
---
## Rain analysis

![Stats](https://github.com/Gdreyes172/Surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/Rain_Stats.png)
### Based on these results we can see that rain on Oahua shouldn't be much of a scare for business as our average rain fall for the island is less than an inch in the established time frame. With this observation, we will then focus on temperature to identify seasonal differences.

## Temperature analysis
### We feel confident that based on the rain fall analysis that our focus on the temperature data we can better identify the type of store we should establish. We first looked used the data provided to identify which site was most active on average. The following data is based on site USC00519281, on of the nine sites on the island.

#### June Temperatures at our most Active site:
### Our June temperatures per Figure1 averaged about 75F with a max temperature of about 85F and a minimum temp of about 64F.

![Figure_4](https://github.com/Gdreyes172/Surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/December_plot.png)
#### December Temperatures at our most Active site:
### As assumed the December temperatures per Figure3 were slightly lower than our summer temperatures. They averaged at about 71F with a max temperature of about 83F and a minimum temp of about 56F.

# Summary:
## When comparing our data, there were suttle differences between the two seasons with more mild temperatures in the winter months, however, there was not enough variance in the temperatures to make this shop seasonal. 
# Conclusion: The Surfs-up: Surf and Ice Cream shop should benefit from year round sells for both its ice cream and supplying surfing equipment all year long.
